Everyone worked together to sketch an E/R diagram and discuss big picture aspects of the project. Julia spearheaded the creation of the relational schema. Julia and Clara detailed the assumptions and logistics of the schema. Jennifer and Clara focused on specifying the contents and constraints of the main tables. Julia and Nicole focused on creating the triggers for what follows a product purchase. Caroline created inputs for the CSVs to load onto our database and test it.
